### Description

Its A big d/l (~370kb) but its worth it. This is just about a fully functional MP3 & CD player. It has a nice GUI and toon of options. Some of those options are: play,pause,stop,resume,repeat,random,playlist,save list,load list,and lots more. I will be updating ASAP to add some stuff like mp3 to wav wave to mp3 and possably a cd ripper. PS you can save and load winamp playlist. Now has save settings, and skinnable and much more!
